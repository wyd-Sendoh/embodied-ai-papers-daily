### [Sequential Planning via Anchored Robotic Keypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.30613v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.30613v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-29
- **作者**: Bryce Grant, Aryeh Rothenberg, Logan Senning, Zonghe Chua, Zach Patterson, Peng Wang

We present Sequential Planning via Anchored Robotic Keypoints, SPARK, a training-free neurosymbolic manipulation system that reaches 43.7% on six LIBERO-PRO position \& task cells, more than doubling CaP-Agent0 and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baselines. CaP-Agent0, a multi-turn code-generation agent, achieves 18.2% by re-querying an LLM at every turn, but its restart-from-scratch solution proves costly against minor policy failures. Perception is the layer that fails most under position and task changes so SPARK spends its computation there. A single Gemini call composes the plan as a typed…

### [Training Vision-Language-Action Models with Dense Embodied Chain-of-Thought Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.30552v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.30552v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-29
- **作者**: Haoyang Li, Guanlin Li, Youhe Feng, Chen Zhao, Zhuoran Wang, Yang Li et al.

Cross-embodiment transfer in vision-language-action (VLA) models remains challenging because low-level state and action spaces differ fundamentally across robot platforms. We observe that the high-level cognitive process underlying manipulation, including scene perception, object identification, task planning, and sub-task decomposition, is largely shared across embodiments. Based on this observation, we present ZR-0, a 2.6 billion parameter end-to-end VLA model that uses dense Embodied Chain-of-Thought (ECoT) supervision to align cross-embodiment representations within the vision-language…

### [Vision-Language-Action Models: Experimental Insights from a Real-World UR5 Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.30456v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.30456v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-29
- **作者**: Mathilde Hochedel, Marc Lalonde

This project investigates whether recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be transferred from controlled research benchmarks to a real-world robotic platform, specifically a UR5e manipulator, in a reproducible and operationally meaningful manner. The work integrates real-robot data acquisition, dataset engineering (compatible with the RLDS format), and the fine-tuning and deployment of OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT models, with systematic validation of action representations and control interfaces. The project resulted in several foundational assets: (i) a complete real-robot data…

### [Automating the Design of Embodied AgentArchitectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.30111v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.30111v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-29
- **作者**: Jian Zhou, Sihao Lin, Jin Li, Shuai Fu, Gengze Zhou, Qi Wu

Embodied agents are typically built as hand-designed compositions of perception, memory, planning, and action modules. This modularity exposes a large architectural design space, but current systems still rely on researcher intuition to choose where information is stored, how observations are processed, and how model calls are connected. Agent Architecture Search (AAS) automates such design for text-domain agents, but has not been systematically evaluated on perceptual embodied agents through simulator rollouts. We study this transfer. We introduce AgentCanvas, a typed-graph runtime that…

### [OpenSPM: An Environment-Transferable Robotic Key Spatial Pose Memory and Closed-Loop High-Frequency Flow-Matching Action Generation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.29936v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.29936v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-29
- **作者**: Iok Tong Lei, Qingchen Xie, Yifan Wang, Yap Ying Jie, Zhidong Deng

Open-environment tabletop robotic manipulation requires systems to possess semantic understanding, precise geometric pose estimation, and high-frequency action generation. While end-to-end vision-language-action (VLA) models excel at semantic generalization, they often lack explicit geometric constraints for fine-grained tasks and require costly training. To bridge the gap between high-level semantics and low-level physical execution, we propose OpenSPM, an open environment spatial persistent memory framework consisting of spatial pose memory and flow-matching action generation model. OpenSPM…

### [Critical Interval MSE: Toward Reliable Offline Validation for Robot Manipulation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.29898v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.29898v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-29
- **作者**: Haoxu Huang, Tongsam Zheng, Yifan Chen, Jiacheng You, Yang Gao

Real-world evaluation is the gold standard for robot policies because it tests them against the physical conditions and deployment challenges they are ultimately designed to handle. However, real-world evaluation is also the bottleneck for iterating on robot policies: it is costly, difficult to reproduce, and often too sparse to reliably compare nearby model variants. A straightforward proxy for performance is validation loss on expert demonstrations, but this proxy is often poorly correlated with real-world performance. In this paper, we introduce Critical Interval MSE (CI-MSE), an…

### [Trust Your Instincts: Confidence-Driven Test-Time RL for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.29892v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.29892v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-29
- **作者**: Siyao Chen, Jiakang Yuan, Jiaxin Wang, Tao Chen

Reinforcement learning (RL) has become indispensable for pushing Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) beyond static imitation learning. However, existing RL methods typically require external environmental feedback, relying on predefined success signals to guide policy updates. In this work, we show that VLA models possess useful internal evaluative capabilities: in discrete-action VLAs, trajectories with higher generation confidence are significantly more likely to succeed. Based on this observation, we introduce T^2VLA (Test-time VLA), an architecture-agnostic test-time RL framework that…

### [Early Warning Signals for OpenVLA Failure under Visual Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.29699v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.29699v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-29
- **作者**: Dipesh Tharu Mahato, Rachel Ren

Vision Language Action models combine perception, language grounding, and control in a single policy, but their failures are hard to diagnose once visual conditions shift. We test whether OpenVLA feedforward activations contain linearly decodable information about near term task failure in LIBERO manipulation rollouts. The policy is fixed throughout. We log internal activations during execution and fit lightweight monitors after the rollouts are collected. Occlusion is the main controlled stress test. It reduces OpenVLA success from $57\%$ to $17\%$ over $100$ episodes per condition. Under…

### [Event-VLA: Action-Conditioned Event Fusion for Robust Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.29384v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.29384v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-28
- **作者**: Jiaxin Liu, Xun Xu, Zhenhao Zhang, Hanqing Wang, Ruiqi Chen, Shi Chang et al.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become an important paradigm of embodied AI. However, existing VLA models typically assume well-lit and stable indoor settings, while real-world embodied manipulation may involve degraded RGB observations caused by illumination shifts, posing critical challenges for robust robotic manipulation. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Event-VLA}, an event-enhanced VLA framework for generalizable manipulation across varying illumination conditions. We formulate VLA-based manipulation under degraded visibility as a practical robustness problem for…

### [Fast Enough to Act: Spatio-Temporal Visual Token Merging for Low-Latency Robotic VLMs and VLAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.29350v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.29350v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-28
- **作者**: Junzhou Chen, Jindong Wang, Gang Zhou

Vision-language models and vision-language action models endow the robot with unprecedented capabilities. However, the input of video and high-resolution images yields a massive number of visual tokens, leading to extremely high inference latency and severely hindering the robot's real-time control. To break through this computational bottleneck, we propose ST-Merge, a plug-and-play, training-free framework that efficiently fuses redundant tokens directly during the visual encoding phase. By explicitly constructing 3D spatiotemporal coordinates, it employs a multi-queue parallel matching and…

### [SurgVLA-Bench: Towards Evaluating Vision-Language-Action Models for Laparoscopic Surgical Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.29247v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.29247v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-28
- **作者**: Jiashuo Sun, Yue He, Wenxuan Liu, Tao Mao, Jiazheng Wang, Xiang Chen et al.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a promising direction for embodied intelligence in surgical robotics. Despite the prevalence of VLA benchmarks for general robotics, standardized evaluation platforms specifically designed for surgical contexts remain absent. To address this limitation, we present SurgVLA-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA models in laparoscopic surgical robotics. Leveraging the SurRoL simulation platform, we construct a hierarchical task taxonomy ranging from atomic actions to complete surgical procedures, complemented by a…

### [TAP-VLA: Tactile Annotation Prompting for Vision Language Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.29089v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.29089v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-27
- **作者**: Mark Van der Merwe, Mohamad Louai Shehab, Jayjun Lee, Youngsun Wi, Yinpei Dai, Dmitry Berenson et al.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate impressive reasoning over visual, semantic, and spatial task variations by leveraging large-scale vision and language pre-training. They remain, however, largely blind to contact forces, which seldom manifest clearly in visual feedback but are central to contact-rich manipulation. Tactile sensing measures these forces directly, but integrating it into VLAs is difficult: tactile data is absent from the large-scale corpora used to pre-train VLAs, so adding it as a new input modality induces a distribution shift that erodes the very pre-training…

### [ViPSim: Collaborating Visual and Parameter Spaces for Consistent Long-Horizon Embodied World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.28804v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.28804v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-27
- **作者**: Longyu Chen, Heng Li, Wei Yang, Manqi Zhao, Dongsheng Jiang

Embodied World Models (EWMs) have emerged as a scalable and risk-free paradigm for advancing embodied intelligence, enabling the safety-critical evaluation of Vision-Language-Action systems. However, their reliability as evaluation benchmarks and foundational simulators is often hindered by the representation gap between low-dimensional actions and high-dimensional video synthesis. This gap results in a lack of geometric correspondence, manifesting as accumulated trajectory drift and inconsistent robot-object interactions during long-horizon rollouts. To bridge this gap, we propose ViPSim, a…

### [X-Mind: Efficient Visual Chain-of-Thought via Predictive World Model for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.28758v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.28758v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-27
- **作者**: Bohao Zhao, Chengrui Wei, Guangfeng Jiang, Ruixin Liu, Xuejie Lv, Liu Liang et al.

Predicting future states is essential for autonomous agents, yet current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models fundamentally lack this capability, relying instead on reactive perception-action mapping. While integrating Predictive World Models (PWMs) addresses this gap, existing approaches either incur prohibitive cascaded latency or act as shallow terminal tasks that fail to deeply embed forward-looking reasoning. To endow VLA models with this reasoning capability, we propose X-Mind. Rather than treating PWMs as an external auxiliary module, this framework internalizes them as the Visual…

### [Translation as a Bridging Action: Transferring Manipulation Skills from Humans to Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.28133v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.28133v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-26
- **作者**: Sijin Chen, Kaixuan Jiang, Haixin Shi, Yanhui Wang, Weiheng Zhong, Haosheng Li et al.

We study whether we can learn novel manipulation skills from human actions to a bi-manual robot with parallel grippers. Human action data is cheap, abundant, and diverse, making it one of the most promising resources for scaling up robot learning. Yet transferring skills from humans to robots remains hard: most prior work treats humans as just another bi-manual 6DoF embodiment, where hand-pose estimates are noisy and the contact patterns of human fingers differ fundamentally from those of a parallel gripper. We argue that learning rotation-inclusive action signals from human data is therefore…

### [S$^2$-VLA: State-Space Guided Vision-Language-Action Models for Long-Horizon Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27872v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27872v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-26
- **作者**: Zhipeng Xie, Zongyi Han, Xiangyi Wei, Shiliang Sun, Yang Li, Jing Zhao

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong capabilities in robotic manipulation, but their performance degrades significantly in long-horizon tasks due to cumulative error propagation. This limitation largely arises from static feature fusion mechanisms that rely on fixed weights to combine visual, language, and action representations, preventing the model from adapting to different phases of task execution. To address this limitation, we propose S$^2$-VLA, a framework that introduces a State-Space Guided Adaptive Attention (SSGAA) mechanism. SSGAA maintains a belief state…

### [SpikeVLA: Vision-Language-Action Models with Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27807v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27807v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-26
- **作者**: Ruiqi Song, Dujun Nie, Siyu Teng, Baiyong Ding, Xiaotong Zhang, Dong Li et al.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a dominant paradigm for embodied intelligence. However, most existing approaches are built on large-scale transformers, resulting in substantial inference latency and energy consumption that limit their practical deployment in low-power, real-time scenarios. We propose SpikeVLA, a spiking VLA architecture for embodied navigation with energy-efficient inference, consisting of three key components. (i) A spiking vision encoder, Spike-V, that replaces dense continuous layers with event-driven spiking layers to reduce the energy consumption of…

### [Drop-Then-Recovery: How Redundant Are Vision-Language-Action Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27755v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27755v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-26
- **作者**: Guoheng Sun, Kaixi Feng, Shwai He, Xiaochuan Gong, Yexiao He, Ziyao Wang et al.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable instruction-driven robotic manipulation, but they inherit oversized language backbones from pretrained VLMs whose capacity far exceeds what is needed for short robotic instructions. This raises a basic question: how much of a VLA model is actually necessary for closed-loop control? In this work, we study architectural redundancy in VLA models by using transformer block removal as a controlled intervention. We introduce \textbf{Drop-Then-Recovery (DTR)}, an analysis protocol that removes selected blocks from a pretrained VLA model and then fine-tunes…

### [Direct Action-Head Injection of A Grounded 3D Point Unlocks Spatial and Task Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27663v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27663v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-26
- **作者**: Shiang-Feng Tsai, Jin-Cheng Jhang, Yen-Ling Tai, Jia-Hong Lai, Shih-Yun Wong,  KangTung-Hsu et al.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage large-scale vision-language pretraining for flexible robot manipulation, yet at test time they remain brittle along two axes: spatial generalization, when object positions differ from those seen during training, and task generalization, when a familiar scene is paired with a different language instruction than the one seen in training. A growing family of methods addresses this brittleness by endowing a policy with the spatial and task-aware information such as 2D pixel-coordinate for object localization and placement. However, we find that…

### [Scalable Behavior Cloning with Open Data, Training, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27375v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27375v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Arthur Allshire, Himanshu Gaurav Singh, Ritvik Singh, Adam Rashid, Hongsuk Choi, David McAllister et al.

We introduce ABC, a fully open-source stack for manipulation with behavior cloning. At its core is ABC-130K: the largest open-source teleoperation dataset to date, featuring 3,500 hours of data spanning over 130K episodes across 195 diverse tasks. Furthermore, we open-source our accessible hardware setup, training infrastructure, and simulation pipeline. We also release 400 hours of sim-teleop data and provide a co-training recipe that produces correlated simulation and real-world evaluation, offering a reliable proxy for ablating model-design and training decisions before costly real-world…

### [RouterVLA: Turning Smoke Tests into Supervision for Heterogeneous VLA Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27355v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27355v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Xingyu Ren, Chugang Yi, Ge Ma, Youran Sun

We study whether pre-deployment evaluation rollouts can be reused to supervise policy selection. Robot teams routinely smoke test candidate vision-language-action (VLA) policies, then compress those trials into a global winner. RouterVLA evaluates this idea with outcome-disjoint cross-fitting: recorded probes build a profile for each frozen expert, and a separate trial scores the selected expert without entering its profile. Across 34,752 LIBERO-Plus rollout records, a transparent probe-success rule raises held-out success from 0.4686 to 0.6149, a +14.64pp gain. Under the scalar-only profiles…

### [LA4VLA: Learning to Act without Seeing via Language-Action Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27295v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27295v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Tao Lin, Yuxin Du, Yiran Mao, Zewei Ye, Yilei Zhong, Bing Cheng et al.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are commonly pretrained on robot demonstrations by jointly mapping visual observations and language instructions to actions. However, dense visual-action supervision can dominate the comparatively sparse language-action signal. As a result, policies may rely on visual shortcuts rather than learn how language conditions action execution, making them sensitive to visual variations. To address this limitation, we propose LA4VLA, a language-action pretraining framework that enables policies to acquire language-conditioned action priors without visual…

### [E-TTS: A New Embodied Test-Time Scaling Framework for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27268v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27268v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Wen Ye, Peiyan Li, Tingyu Yuan, Yuan Xu, Xiangnan Wu, Chaoyang Zhao et al.

Recently, a few works have made early attempts to study test-time scaling for embodied tasks. However, two major challenges remain unsolved: (1) reasoning can effectively improve the performance of the policy, but its scaling mechanism has seldom been studied; (2) historical information is essential, as embodied tasks are inherently long-horizon and sequential, making sole reliance on current observations for action scaling inadequate due to the lack of historical context utilization. To address these challenges, we introduce E-TTS, a modular and plug-and-play Embodied Test-Time Scaling…

### [PhysReflect-VLA: Physical Feasibility and Self-Reflective Regulation for Reliable Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27146v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27146v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Jiayu Yang, Tao Yang, Weijun Li, Xiang Chang, Fei Chao, Changjing Shang et al.

Long-horizon robotic manipulation is highly sensitive to physically infeasible transitions, contact-induced disturbances, and the lack of effective self-correction during execution. Although Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models provide strong task grounding through multimodal learning, they typically generate actions in a feed-forward manner without explicitly checking physical feasibility or diagnosing execution errors online. We present PhysReflect-VLA, a plug-and-play execution-time reliability framework that augments VLA policies with physical feasibility evaluation and structured…

### [PAMAE: Phase-Aware-MoE Action Experts Towards Reliable Flow-Matching Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27144v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27144v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Jiayu Yang, Tao Yang, Xiang Chang, Fei Chao, Changjing Shang, Qiang Shen

Reliable action generation for multi-stage robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. While existing flow-matching VLA policies offer strong multimodal grounding and generalization, they typically employ a single shared action expert, limiting their ability to capture phase-specific control patterns across distinct execution stages. We propose a plug-and-play Phase-Aware Mixture-of-Experts Action Module (PAMAE), as a step towards more reliable phase-consistent action generation. PAMAE replaces the original flow-matching action expert with a sparse expert…

### [Improving Vision-Language-Action Model Fine-Tuning with Structured Stage and Keyframe Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26801v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26801v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Yuan Xu, Yixiang Chen, Kai Wang, Jiabing Yang, Peiyan Li, Qisen Ma et al.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong potential for generalizable robotic manipulation. During fine-tuning, however, action supervision applies equally across all timesteps, without structured supervision on which manipulation stage the robot is in or what the next gripper-event target should be. This causes failures to concentrate around challenging gripper-event transitions. To address this, we propose StaKe, a plug-in auxiliary supervision framework that automatically derives two complementary signals from demonstration gripper states without manual annotation: a stage…

### [Inference-Time Robot Behavior Steering through Physically-Aware Reconfiguration of Task-Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26588v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26588v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Yiyuan Pan, Hanjiang Hu, Shangtao Li, Xusheng Luo, Changliu Liu

A central challenge in deploying learned robot policies is inference-time behavior steering: redirecting a policy at test time to satisfy user preferences not anticipated during training, without retraining. Existing methods fail in two modes: end-to-end methods require fine-tuning or expert-level guidance, while neuro-symbolic methods rely on predefined symbols whose edits can result in logically reasonable but physically infeasible plans. To address this challenge, we propose ReStruct, which builds upon a neural automaton policy that decomposes a visuomotor policy into a high-level…

### [Learning Action Priors for Cross-embodiment Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26095v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26095v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Dong Jing, Tianqi Zhang, Jiaqi Liu, Jinman Zhao, Zelong Sun, Li Erran Li et al.

Most Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models build on a Vision-Language Model (VLM) backbone by attaching an action module and optimizing the full policy jointly. This design inherits strong visual and linguistic priors from the VLM, but leaves the action module to learn physical motion almost from scratch. As a result, the policy lacks an explicit motion prior, forcing early optimization to simultaneously discover temporal action dynamics and cross-modal alignment, a challenge further amplified in cross-embodiment settings. In this work, we propose to pretrain the action module with motion…

### [ForceBand: Learning Forceful Manipulation with sEMG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26093v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26093v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Botao He, Zhi Wang, Linna Kuang, Ishaan Ghosh, Jitendra Malik, Cornelia Fermuller et al.

Human demonstrations are a scalable data source for learning robot manipulation policies. However, common sources of human demonstration data, such as motion-capture trajectories and internet videos, capture mostly motion and appearance while missing the contact forces that are critical for force-sensitive manipulation. In this paper, we introduce ForceBand, a low-cost wrist-worn sEMG system that turns human muscle activity into force-enriched demonstrations. We first collect a 10-hour multimodal dataset containing egocentric video, sEMG, IMU, and fingertip force measurements across diverse…

### [FORCE: Efficient VLA Reinforcement Fine-Tuning via Value-Calibrated Warm-up and Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26006v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26006v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Shuyi Zhang, Yunfan Lou, Hongyang Cheng, Yichen Guo, Chuyao Fu, Yaoxu Lyu et al.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are often constrained by the imitation ceiling imposed by sub-optimal data. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning can surpass this limit, it is notoriously sample inefficient. This challenge arises from two core issues: (1) catastrophic initial unlearning due to an unstable Q-function and (2) inefficient policy updates caused by low-quality exploration data, often forcing a reliance on costly human interventions. We introduce FORCE, a 3-stage framework that stabilizes fine-tuning by tackling both issues. FORCE first incorporates a Value-Calibrated…

### [Action ControlNet: A Lightweight Delay-Aware Adapter for Smooth Asynchronous Control in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.25985v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.25985v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Tiecheng Guo, Meng Guo

Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown strong potential for general-purpose robot manipulation, but their inference latency remains a major obstacle to stable high-frequency control. Asynchronous execution mitigates this bottleneck by overlapping policy inference with action execution, yet the next action chunk is still predicted from stale observations while the robot continues to move. Direct chunk stitching therefore introduces handoff discontinuities, action jitter, and failures in contact-rich manipulation. Existing remedies typically require either full-policy retraining or…

### [ROAD-VLA: Robust Online Adaptation via Self-Distillation for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.25800v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.25800v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Kejing Wang, Toan Nguyen, Minh Hoang Nguyen, Simon Khan, Flora D. Salim

Effective online adaptation of vision-language-action (VLA) models remains challenging, as sparse rewards provide weak supervision for high-dimensional autoregressive action policies. Although self-distillation can in principle provide denser training signals, we find that text-based privileged teachers conditioned on demonstrations, retrieved experiences, or high-level plans are ineffective for VLA adaptation, exposing a modality gap between symbolic guidance and low-level robot actions. We propose ROAD-VLA, an advantage-guided self-distillation framework that constructs a proximal teacher…

### [Decoupling Semantics and Geometric Grounding: Spatial Visual Prompts for Language-Conditioned Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.25360v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.25360v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Yanzhe Tang, Xinyu Shao, Yuxuan Hu, Siyu Chen, Bowen Yang, Yajun Gao et al.

While end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in robotic manipulation, their monolithic paradigm inherently couples semantic reasoning and spatial control. This creates a severe alignment bottleneck, limiting precise target disambiguation in data-constrained imitation learning. To overcome this, we propose SVP-IL, a decoupled architecture that explicitly extracts spatial visual grounding from the action generation loop. By leveraging vision-language foundation models, we parse instructions into zero-shot geometric masks, translating language into explicit Spatial Visual…
