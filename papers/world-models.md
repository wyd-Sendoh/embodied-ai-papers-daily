### [Deform360: A Massive Multi-view Visuotactile Dataset for Deformable World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.05390v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.05390v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-06
- **作者**: Hongyu Li, Wanjia Fu, Xiaoyan Cong, Zekun Li, Binghao Huang, Hanxiao Jiang et al.

Predicting object dynamics (i.e., world modeling) is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulation, and modeling deformable objects presents a particularly difficult case due to their high-dimensional state spaces and complex material properties. While current world models approach this through two distinct paradigms: learning the dynamics over the 2D pixel space or more explicit 3D geometric space. A systematic understanding of their relative strengths and limitations remains elusive due to the lack of diverse, large-scale real-world data. To address this, we present Deform360, a…

### [Multiplayer Interactive World Models with Representation Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.05352v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.05352v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-06
- **作者**: Anthony Hu, Václav Volhejn, Adrien Ramanana Rahary, Chris Mulder, Aditya Makkar, Amélie Royer et al.

We introduce the first multiplayer world model for highly dynamic environments governed by complex physical interactions. Whereas single-player world models treat the other agents as part of the environment, ours conditions on the action streams of multiple agents, learning to attribute changes in the scene to the correct player and to stay coherent under arbitrary combinations of their actions. We study this problem in the game of Rocket League, where players compete and cooperate under fast, tightly coupled dynamics. Trained on 10,000 hours of gameplay collected with publicly available…

### [MoP-JEPA: Hard-Assigned Predictor Mixtures for Stochastic JEPA World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.05238v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.05238v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-06
- **作者**: Zhi Song, Ximing Xing, Zhenchao Tang, hanbo Huang, Tianxu Lv, minghao Yang et al.

JEPA world models predict the next latent state with a single deterministic predictor trained by latent regression. We show that this fails structurally when the environment is stochastic: at a branching transition, the regression-optimal predictor outputs the conditional mean of the successor embeddings, a point between the true next states that corresponds to no state at all. We prove this collapse for deterministic and gated mixture-of-experts predictors, and prove that MoP-JEPA's hard-assigned predictors converge instead to a quantizer of the transition distribution: one head per…

### [InternVLA-A1.5: Unifying Understanding, Latent Foresight, and Action for Compositional Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.04988v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.04988v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-06
- **作者**: Haoxiang Ma, Junhao Cai, Xiaoxu Xu, Hao Li, Yuyin Yang, Yang Tian et al.

Unified models for robot manipulation aim to equip one policy with both the semantic priors of pretrained VLMs and the physical dynamics learned through future prediction. In practice, existing designs tend to erode the semantics of the pretrained backbone, suffer interference among heterogeneous objectives, and learn future prediction from scratch in pixel space, leaving the dynamics priors of pretrained video generators unexploited. We present InternVLA-A1.5, which builds the policy on a native VLM backbone that keeps training on VQA and subtask prediction, and attaches a lightweight…

### [Qantara: Bridge-Flow Training for Multi-Paradigm JEPA Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.04978v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.04978v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-06
- **作者**: Ruslan Rakhimov, George Bredis, Yuriy Maksyuta, Daniil Gavrilov

Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) underpin a growing family of latent world models for control from raw pixels, but every existing JEPA world model commits at training time to a single inference paradigm: either trajectory optimisation in a learned dynamics model, or direct behaviour cloning. A single checkpoint that serves both would defer this choice to inference, when deployment constraints (rollout cost, observation accessibility) determine which path wins. We present Qantara, an end-to-end JEPA whose joint training objective pairs a Brownian-bridge interpolant between…

### [KAM-WM: Kinematic Affordance Maps from Latent World Models for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.04652v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.04652v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-06
- **作者**: Xinyu Shao, Keru Zhou, Guowei Huang, Yajun Gao, Tongtong Cao, Xiu Li

Learning manipulation from few demonstrations requires visual priors that capture not only where to interact, but also how the interaction should begin; static priors such as segmentation masks encode only the former. We present KAM-WM, a framework that extracts a coarse directional interaction cue from a frozen latent video world model without rollout or world-model fine-tuning. KAM-WM queries a Flow Matching image-to-video backbone once and interprets its single-step latent velocity as a Kinematic Affordance Map (KAM), which provides task-conditioned interaction regions and coarse motion…

### [CRISP: A Spatiotemporal Camera-Radar Backbone for Driving via Forecasting-Based World-Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.04541v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.04541v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-05
- **作者**: Jingyu Song, Yi Liu, Katherine A. Skinner

Camera-radar (CR) fusion is a practical sensing configuration for autonomous driving, but existing models are typically trained with task-specific supervision, limiting reusable representation learning. We present CRISP, a spatiotemporal CR backbone pretrained through forecasting-based representation learning. Given historical multi-view images and radar sweeps, CRISP learns a unified bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation by predicting future LiDAR point clouds. LiDAR is used only as privileged supervision during pretraining; the deployed model requires only camera and radar. To make…

### [Geographic Diversity Beats Data Volume for Cross-Domain Generalization in Zero-Label JEPA Driving World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.04500v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.04500v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-05
- **作者**: Santosh Jaiswal

Self-supervised latent world models can assign a surprise score to driving scenarios without any human labels. A natural follow-up question is whether such a model, trained on driving data from one geographic region, can generalize its notion of complexity to unseen cities and sensor configurations. We study this question through a controlled transfer experiment: we train JEPA-based world models on nuPlan data (Pittsburgh, Boston, Singapore) and evaluate zero-shot on held-out Argoverse 2 validation scenarios from Miami and Austin. We find that models trained on geographically diverse data…

### [Operator-on-F complements value-equivalence: a planning-time diagnostic for latent world models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.04464v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.04464v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-05
- **作者**: Donna Vakalis

World-model evaluation for model-based reinforcement learning typically asks whether the learned model predicts reward and value well, which can leave planning-relevant errors in the model's latent rollouts unmeasured. We introduce a complementary diagnostic, operator-on-F, that compares a model's k-step latent pushforward to the environment's on an observable subset F, using the model's own predictor. On a TD-MPC2 size sweep over cheetah-run, reward-prediction error stays within [0.028, 0.091] for every model size - only about 3x variation - so an unnormalized reward-fit check has narrow…

### [Learning Task-Sufficient World Models by Synergizing Agentic Exploration and Structured Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.04409v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.04409v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-05
- **作者**: Fan Feng, Yujia Zheng, Minghao Fu, Yongqiang Chen, Guangyi Chen, Kevin Murphy et al.

Learning and planning in imagination using world models provides an effective paradigm for training agents for decision-making. However, existing approaches often rely on high-dimensional latent spaces or generic visual embeddings that retain many factors irrelevant to control, limiting efficiency and generalization across tasks. To this end, we study how agents can learn world models with representations that are task-specific, minimal, and sufficient for decision-making. We achieve this via a closed-loop synergy between the agent and the world model, in which structured world-model learning…

### [Last-Meter Precision Navigation for UAVs: A Diffusion-Refined Aerial Visual Servoing Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.04352v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.04352v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-05
- **作者**: Yaxuan Li, Jiarui Zeng, Shaofei Huang, Zhedong Zheng

In this work, we study the last-meter precision navigation for UAVs, e.g., autonomously reaching a target within the final 10 meters using monocular vision. This task is challenging due to scale ambiguity, rotation discontinuities, and the need for fine-grained spatial reasoning. Existing methods often fail under large viewpoint changes or lack generalization to unseen environments. To this end, we propose DreamNav, a coarse-to-fine diffusion-refined aerial visual servoing framework. In the first coarse-estimation stage, a robust regression policy employs a trigonometric parameterization to…

### [DynaVieW: Schema-Guided World Modeling for Understanding Hierarchical Visual Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.04112v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.04112v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-05
- **作者**: Silin Gao, Hao Zhao, Zeming Chen, Sepideh Mamooler, Antara Raaghavi Bhattacharya, Qiyu Wu et al.

Multimodal LLMs struggle to systematically model the temporal evolution of visual scenes in videos or multi-image sequences. Such inputs require models to predict or simulate multiple levels of dynamic constituents, such as actions taken in the visual sequence, and the associated changes to the visual environment that result. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic schema-guided world model, DynaVieW, optimized for visual dynamic prediction and simulation. DynaVieW achieves an in-depth understanding of visual dynamics by learning interleaved state-transition sequences, where states…

### [Worldscape-MoE: A Unified Mixture-of-Experts World Model for Scalable Heterogeneous Action Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.03964v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.03964v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-04
- **作者**: Jianjie Fang, Yongyan Xu, Ziyou Wang, Chen Gao, Yuchao Huang, Zhaolu Wang et al.

World models are rapidly becoming a core infrastructure for embodied intelligence and interactive agents: they provide controllable simulators in which agents can perceive, act, forecast, and acquire scalable experience. Yet current video generation world models are still organized around isolated control interfaces, such as camera trajectories, robot actions, or hand-joint signals. This fragmentation is increasingly a scaling bottleneck. The central challenge is not the absence of controllable generators, but the lack of a unified and extensible learning framework that can absorb…

### [ThermoForce: A Physics-Structured Interventional World Model for Building HVAC Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.03942v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.03942v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-04
- **作者**: Yifan Wang

Model predictive control (MPC) of building HVAC systems needs thermal models that answer a causal question: what indoor temperature, energy use, and comfort will result if a control action is applied? Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) can forecast passive building trajectories with strong zero-shot skill, but high factual accuracy does not imply valid response to control interventions. We show that an observational grey-box model with the best passive accuracy predicts cooling effects with the wrong sign, and that adding control and weather covariates to a TSFM does not fix intervention…

### [WorldDirector: Building Controllable World Simulators with Persistent Dynamic Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.02517v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.02517v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-02
- **作者**: Hanlin Wang, Hao Ouyang, Qiuyu Wang, Wen Wang, Qingyan Bai, Ka Leong Cheng et al.

We present WorldDirector, a highly controllable video world model framework designed for persistent dynamic object memory and unrestricted viewpoint exploration. Unlike existing world models that entangle physical dynamics with pixel rendering and rely on continuous visual observation to sustain motion, our framework explicitly decouples semantic motion orchestration from visual generation. By leveraging an LLM to coordinate 3D trajectories with camera movements and subsequently employing these orchestrated trajectories as control signals for video generation, our approach ensures strict…

### [WorldSample: Closed-loop Real-robot RL with World Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.02431v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.02431v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-02
- **作者**: Yuquan Xue, Le Xu, Zeyi Liu, Zhenyu Wu, Zhengyi Gu, Xinyang Song et al.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can overcome the demonstration-coverage limitation of imitation learning (IL) by allowing robots to improve through trial-and-error interaction beyond the states observed in demonstrations. However, deploying RL on real robots remains constrained by high interaction costs, since each physical rollout is costly and reflects only one realized action-outcome path. To address this challenge, we propose WorldSample, a physically grounded data augmentation framework for real-robot RL that closes a real-synthetic loop between physical rollouts, world-model generation, and…

### [ACID: Action Consistency via Inverse Dynamics for Planning with World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.02403v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.02403v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-02
- **作者**: Gawon Seo, Dongwon Kim, Suha Kwak

Decision-time planning with action-conditioned world models has become a popular paradigm for embodied control. However, the standard planning cost judges a candidate solely by how close its predicted terminal state lies to the goal, leaving the realizability of the intermediate transitions unchecked -- a predicted trajectory can look convincing while the environment rollout drifts away from it. In this paper, we propose ACID, a decision-time planning framework that introduces cycle action consistency: the action inferred backward from a predicted transition by an inverse dynamics model…

### [DecompRL: Solving Harder Problems by Learning Modular Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.02390v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.02390v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-02
- **作者**: Juliette Decugis, Fabian Gloeckle, Francis Bach, Taco Cohen, Gabriel Synnaeve

How can Large Language Models (LLMs) solve problems they currently cannot? Repeated sampling scales test-time compute but GPU cost grows linearly with attempts, while reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards improves single-attempt accuracy at the expense of sample diversity. Both strategies ultimately fail when the base policy has near-zero probability of producing a correct solution: no amount of sampling or gradient signal can overcome a search space that is simply too large. We take a different approach: rather than sampling harder, we make the task easier by decomposing…

### [Hardware-Enforced Semantic Coordination for Safety-Critical Real-Time Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.02376v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.02376v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-02
- **作者**: Uwe M. Borghoff, Paolo Bottoni, Remo Pareschi

Recent advances in agentic AI are producing increasingly complex autonomous systems that integrate large language models, world models, optimization engines, specialized neural architectures, autonomous platforms, and human operators. While much current research focuses on improving reasoning capabilities, safety-critical real-time deployment also requires bounded and verifiable coordination among heterogeneous components operating concurrently under uncertainty. Software-mediated coordination presents fundamental limitations in domains where bounded latency, deterministic coordination, and…

### [PWM-ArtGen: Part World Model for Articulated Object Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.02045v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.02045v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-02
- **作者**: Wentao Zheng, Ancong Wu

The key challenge in articulated 3D object generation from a single image is accurately predicting the underlying kinematic structure. Existing methods either infer kinematic parameters directly from a static image that lacks dynamic part-level kinematic relationships, or estimate parameters from visual dynamics generated from a single image, which is prone to accumulated errors of two steps. Moreover, the limited scale and diversity of existing annotated datasets further hinder generalization to complex, real-world objects. To overcome these limitations, we propose to learn the joint…

### [Liquid Latent State Dynamics for Interpretable Turbofan Degradation Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01986v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.01986v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-02
- **作者**: Weizhi Nie, Weijie Wang, Yuting Su

Multivariate time-series models for prognostics are often evaluated by point prediction accuracy, yet their internal states rarely expose a coherent degradation process. We study liquid neural networks as latent dynamics models for aircraft engine health monitoring on the C-MAPSS benchmark. The proposed model encodes a history window into a latent state, evolves that state with a liquid transition model, and decodes future sensor observations. To separate health evolution from operating-condition variation, the latent state is factorized into degradation and condition components. Remaining…

### [PhysMani: Physics-principled 3D World Model for Dynamic Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01938v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.01938v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-02
- **作者**: Peng Yun, Shouwang Huang, Hao Li, Jinxi Li, Jianan Wang, Bo Yang

Manipulating fast and dynamically moving targets in unstructured 3D environments remains challenging for embodied AI. Existing visual-language-action models and world models struggle with accurate 3D geometry and physically meaningful forecasting. We propose PhysMani, a framework that couples a physics-principled 3D Gaussian world model with a future-aware action policy model. The world model learns a divergence-free Gaussian velocity field via online optimization for fast and physically grounded future dynamics prediction. The policy model integrates the predicted 3D scene future dynamics…

### [Repair the Amplifier, Not the Symptom: Stable World-Model Correction for Agent Rollouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01767v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.01767v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-02
- **作者**: Xinyuan Song, Zekun Cai

As agent planning moves from short tool chains toward persistent workflows with thousands or tens of thousands of steps, failures will occur inside large planning graphs rather than in isolated predictions. Replanning the entire graph after every mistake is neither computationally realistic nor desirable: full-graph replay consumes large context budgets, exposes the LLM to many irrelevant symptoms, and can degrade long-context retrieval. This paper studies the missing component in such systems: a world-model corrector that repairs the failed planning graph in place. We compare two families of…

### [Predicting Closed-Loop Performance of Latent World Models: Offline Checkpoint Selection for MPC and Model-Based RL Under Non-Markovian Rewards in LunarLander](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01736v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.01736v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-02
- **作者**: Nikolai Smolyanskiy

We study how to predict the downstream closed-loop performance of a learned latent world model from validation-time diagnostics alone. Choosing the right checkpoint from a world-model training run is difficult: validation loss and multi-step prediction RMSE keep improving long after closed-loop performance has collapsed. We present a suite of structural validation-time diagnostics drawn from optimal-control theory and apply them to Gymnasium's LunarLander v3, which features shaped rewards. We train an RSSM [5, 4] world model on it and treat per checkpoint CEM-MPC return as the oracle for…

### [Safe and Adaptive Cloud Healing: Verifying LLM-Generated Recovery Plans with a Neural-Symbolic World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01595v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.01595v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-02
- **作者**: Junyan Tan, Haoran Lin, Siyuan Guo, Yichen Fang, Xinyue Luo, Tianyu Shen et al.

As the scale and complexity of cloud-based AI systems continue to escalate, ensuring service reliability through rapid fault detection and adaptive recovery has become a critical challenge. While existing approaches integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic understanding and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for policy optimization, they often rely on sequential, loosely coupled architectures that underutilize the generative and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift with PASE, a Planning-Aware Semantic self-healing engine, a novel fault…

### [Certified World Models as Sensing Clocks: Drift-Aware Deadlines for Active Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01537v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.01537v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-01
- **作者**: Hongbo Wang

Certified world models estimate how long their predictions remain valid. We turn this validity horizon into an operational sensing clock: a rule for when an agent should stop coasting and re-sense. Starting from an audited equivariant world model, we derive a deadline for no-sensing intervals and show that deployable deadlines in learned world models must be drift-aware: on-manifold Lyapunov rates alone overestimate coasting validity, while calibrated native rollout-drift envelopes carry the deployed guarantee. On a frozen 3D VN-JEPA model, the resulting clock controls held-out…

### [OPINE-World: Programmatic World Modeling with Ontology-error-Prioritized Interactive Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01531v1)

- **arXiv**: `2607.01531v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-07-01
- **作者**: David Courtis, Wenhao Li, Scott Sanner

Learning how an environment behaves from interaction is central to building agents that adapt to unfamiliar tasks. World models learned with deep networks are flexible but data-hungry and transfer poorly beyond their training distribution. Program-synthesized world models, written as source code by LLMs and refined through counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS), are instead data-efficient and reusable, yet they have been demonstrated mainly on structured-state worlds with a given object vocabulary, and a single program search does not scale to pixel-rendered environments whose…

World models are increasingly used in embodied intelligence and generative simulation, yet their scope remains ambiguous across communities. This tutorial presents a design-space view of world models as action-conditioned predictive models that estimate the future evolution of task-relevant observations or states. We categorize existing methods into observation-space and state-space world models, comparing their trade-offs in visual fidelity, spatial structure, physical interpretability, and control usability. We further introduce world action models, which connect predicted futures with…

### [DVG-WM: Disentangled Video Generation Enables Efficient Embodied World Model for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.32028v2)

- **arXiv**: `2606.32028v2`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-30
- **作者**: Ziyu Shan, Zhenyu Wu, Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Zhu, Ziwei Wang

Video-based embodied world models provide an appealing substrate for robotic manipulation by predicting future states, yet current approaches remain limited by a fundamental entanglement: accurately modeling dynamics typically requires low-level temporal reasoning, while producing high-resolution frames demands expansive visual synthesis according to high-level semantics. This entanglement results in slow inference speed for iterative planning or too coarse predictions to retain contact-rich details. To solve this dilemma, we present Disentangled Video Generation World Model (DVG-WM), an…

### [WorldOdysseyBench: An Open-World Benchmark for Long-Horizon Stability of Interactive World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.31672v2)

- **作者**: Ting-Bing Xu, Jiacheng Sui, Zhe Gao, Kewei Shi, Wenjin Yang, Zhicheng Liu et al.

Despite rapid progress in interactive world models (IWMs), existing benchmarks evaluate action following only at trajectory level and ignore memory and interaction physics. We introduce WorldOdysseyBench, an open-world benchmark for long-horizon stability across four dimensions, each with tailored innovations: (i) Action: per-frame action metric bypassing cross-model semantic scale disparity and exposing failures hidden by trajectory; (ii) Vision: segment-based drift metric capturing non-monotonic mid-sequence collapse missed by start-vs-end comparisons; (iii) Physics: controllability-gated…

Video predictive models are emerging as a powerful paradigm in robotics, offering a promising path toward task generalization, long-horizon planning, and flexible decision-making. However, prevailing approaches often operate on 2D video sequences, inherently lacking the 3D geometric understanding necessary for precise spatial reasoning and physical consistency. We introduce a Structured 4D Latent Predictive Model, which predicts the evolution of a scene's 3D structure in a structured latent space conditioned on observations and textual instructions. Our representation encodes the scene…

### [RoboWorld: Fast and Reliable Neural Simulators for Generalist Robot Policy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01060v1)

Video world models are emerging as a scalable alternative for evaluating generalist robot policies, bypassing the physical constraints and engineering burdens of real-world deployment. However, evaluating policies with video world models remains challenging, as world-model errors can make generated rollouts unreliable and slow inference limits large-scale throughput. We introduce RoboWorld, an automated evaluation pipeline that pairs a fast autoregressive video world model with a task-progress-aware vision-language model scoring. To enable reliable long-horizon autoregressive world-model…

### [Valdi: Value Diffusion World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.00917v1)

- **作者**: Christopher Lindenberg, Kashyap Chitta

World models can enable Model Predictive Control (MPC), but this requires dynamics prediction that is both fast enough for online use and expressive enough to represent uncertain futures. Diffusion models offer a natural mechanism for modeling uncertain dynamics, yet their iterative inference procedure makes them difficult to use for low-latency latent planning. We bridge this gap with Value Diffusion World Models (Valdi), combining end-to-end online training for MPC with a latent diffusion dynamics model. In preliminary experiments on the CarRacing environment, we show that Valdi, using a…

- **作者**: Seok-Young Kim, Abdelrahman Elskhawy, Taewook Ha, Dooyoung Kim, Eunjae Shin, Benjamin Busam et al.

We present DeWorldSG, a novel framework that generates spatio-temporally robust 3D Semantic Scene Graphs from RGB-D sequences. Existing methods often struggle to construct reliable 3D scene graphs due to unstable 3D object representations and missing relations caused by frame-wise inference. DeWorldSG addresses these issues by estimating instance-level geometric 3D Gaussian distributions through depth-guided filtering and representing each object as a probabilistic 3D node rather than a single projected point. To mitigate relational sparsity from frame-wise inference, our framework further…

### [ABot-M0.5: Unified Mobility-and-Manipulation World Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.00678v1)

Mobile manipulation is a key capability for general-purpose robots, yet remains challenging for current embodied learning methods. VLA policies are typically reactive and lack explicit world modeling, while existing World Action Models (WAMs) are still poorly aligned with the structure of mobile manipulation: they operate on coarse video chunks, model entangled navigation-manipulation actions, and train inverse dynamics under supervision that does not match autoregressive inference. As a result, they often miss fine-grained contact dynamics, suffer from action-distribution conflicts, and…

Robots deployed in unstructured outdoor environments often plan from scene reconstructions collected before deployment because operators cannot remap large or remote sites before every mission. As a result, robots must make long-horizon planning decisions using stale maps that assume the terrain remains unchanged, even though physical changes to the environment may render previously feasible routes unsafe or unreachable at execution time. We present a physically viable world model for evaluating what-if queries for robot navigation under future terrain change. The system augments…

Large language models (LLMs) are powerful pattern-completion systems, but their default operating mode - predicting the next token from a static context - does not reliably produce persistent, manipulable representations of an external world. Many tasks that look like "reasoning" in text become substantially harder once the environment is partially observable, stateful, and requires memory and structured hypotheses about hidden state. AGI Maze is a lightweight framework for building such environments without requiring high-dimensional sensory inputs. It provides a family of grid-based maze…

Embodied agents operating in the real world require multi-scale reasoning and knowledge adaptation as conditions change. We identify two challenges in applying Mixture of Experts (MoE) to this setting: routing lacks an explicit notion of scale, preventing targeted updates at specific scales, and a uniform update policy cannot accommodate the different rates at which knowledge at each scale becomes outdated. We present MuSix, a framework that addresses both challenges through scale-aware world model mixture and evolution. A two-stage routing mechanism grounds scale selection in experiential…

Foundation video diffusion models are increasingly viewed as world simulators for embodied agents, yet their pretraining on internet-scale generic video leaves them poorly aligned with real-world deployment domains. We study parameter-efficient adaptation of a pretrained foundation video world model to retail scenes: when synchronized egocentric and exocentric video of the same activity are available, which viewpoint of training data produces the strongest adapted model? We introduce RetailSMV (Retail Synchronized Multi-View), a corpus of 32,105 captioned retail clips from five supermarkets…

Current large-language-model (LLM) physics benchmarks are usually scored by answer accuracy, which cannot distinguish genuine reasoning from recall of familiar problem patterns and reveals little about where a model's reasoning breaks down. We introduce an auditable four-stage diagnostic that evaluates whether an LLM can reason inside an unfamiliar physics framework through induction, formulation, prediction, and review. The diagnostic combines locked pre-registrations, fresh sessions between stages, dual-LLM judging, and a human-audit pathway, and we apply it to three parallel physics…

Camera pose estimation from image streams is a critical component of spatial world models that integrate perception into planning and decision-making. Nearly all Visual Odometry (VO) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) systems have focused on datasets containing raw, uncompressed videos. Many working systems instead use ubiquitous hardware units to efficiently compress and decode video streams, saving orders of magnitude in storage and bandwidth. However, this lossy compression introduces visual artifacts that hinder the performance of traditional tracking systems. We present…

- **作者**: Ziyu Shan, Zhenyu Wu, Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Zhu, Ziwei Wang

Video-based embodied world models provide an appealing substrate for robotic manipulation by predicting future states, yet current approaches remain limited by a fundamental entanglement: accurately modeling dynamics typically requires low-level temporal reasoning, while producing high-resolution frames demands expansive visual synthesis according to high-level semantics. This entanglement results in slow inference speed for iterative planning or too coarse predictions to retain contact-rich details. To solve this dilemma, we present Disentangled Video Generation World Model (DVG-WM), an…

Latent world models enable planning from high-dimensional observations by predicting future states in a compact latent space. However, these models are typically kept frozen at test time: when their predictions become inaccurate, planning can fail, especially under test-time distribution shift. To address this, we propose AdaJEPA, an adaptive latent world model that performs test-time adaptation within the closed loop of model predictive control (MPC). After training, AdaJEPA plans and executes the first action chunk, uses the observed next-state transition as a self-supervised adaptation…

Unstructured navigational features, such as irregular planting or discontinuities, remain the primary failure mode for under-canopy agricultural robots. Existing geometric approaches often fail in these scenarios because they compress high-dimensional visual data into deterministic spatial references, effectively discarding the uncertainty and semantic context required to navigate ambiguous terrain. To address this, we present LeCropFollow, a visual navigation framework that bypasses explicit geometric modeling in favor of a learned latent representation. By integrating a self-supervised…

Video World Models are interactive video generation models that predict future world states based on user actions and history video frames. A critical challenge in video world models is the lack of memory, causing inconsistent generated scenes over extended durations. Previous methods explored rule-based context frame retrieval as memory, but they fail to generalize in scenarios with scene occlusions and dynamic objects. We propose MemLearner, a learning-based adaptive context query method using query tokens to bridge context and predicted tokens. By leveraging the video generation model…

Despite rapid progress in interactive world models (IWMs), existing benchmarks evaluate action following only at trajectory level and ignore memory and interaction physics.

Long-horizon language agents do not only choose actions; they carry a private model of the world from one decision to the next. When that model drifts, a later failure can be decided before the failing action is ever taken. We study a direct repair mechanism: before committing to the next task action, an agent may ask the environment about one belief field and write the answer back into its world model. This makes environment interaction a scarce calibration resource, not merely a way to advance the task. We introduce \method, a budgeted probing operator for structured belief tables. The…

Water looks unchanged as it warms, then at a critical point it boils. We ask whether long-horizon language agents show an analogous transition in their implicit world models. In some parameter settings, changing state load by a small amount, or adding a single step of horizon, leaves behavior nearly unchanged; near a critical boundary, the same small change causes a sudden world collapse. We study this effect in a deterministic task family with exact per-step gold state. A large grid search over state cardinality, dependency density, horizon, branching, observation mode, and mutation rate…

We introduce \textbf{OVOW}, the first training-free system that reconstructs \emph{instance-level, simulation-ready} 4D mesh scenes from a single monocular video. Recent 4D reconstruction achieves impressive rendering quality, but its outputs (\eg, implicit fields, Gaussian primitives, or point clouds) lack the watertight topology, instance separation, and standardized physical interfaces required by physics simulators and embodied AI. OVOW closes this gap with a four-stage pipeline: a vision-language model discovers, labels, and motion-classifies all instances; category-aware reconstruction…

Learning visual world models for planning requires compact latent dynamics that remain sensitive to actions, yet reconstruction-free joint-embedding objectives can collapse to action-insensitive representations. We propose Delta-JEPA, an end-to-end reconstruction-free world model that augments latent forward prediction with a Latent Difference Action Decoder (LDAD). Unlike inverse decoders that infer actions from concatenated endpoint embeddings, LDAD reconstructs the executed action from the latent displacement between consecutive observations. This displacement-level supervision directly…

World-model-based autonomous driving endows the model with the ability to understand scene evolution. Yet this promise is undermined by the prevailing imagine-then-act paradigm, which allows errors from the more challenging visual generation stage to cascade into action planning. We introduce ForgeDrive, a unified autoregressive diffusion framework with visual-action cross-conditioning that closes this gap through act-then-imagine paradigm. ForgeDrive factorizes the future as a sequence of per-timestep frame-action pairs, intertwining each action with its corresponding visual observation.…

Interactive traffic simulation is a vital world model for autonomous driving. A central challenge in long-horizon simulation is modeling sustained multi-agent interactions, which is further exacerbated by dynamic token cardinality as agents continuously enter and exit the scene. In this work, we propose that the solution lies in the synergy between the architectural inductive biases and statistical priors of large-scale sequence models, e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs). Our probing experiments reveal that the transferability of attention mechanisms and the distributional consistency between…

How to accurately predict a high-fidelity future world? While the visual world is inherently continuous, existing deterministic video prediction models operate in discrete pixel space and are mainly optimized with pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE), which often leads to over-smoothed predictions and a lack of fine-grained visual details. To address these limitations, we propose Predictive Differentiable Rendering (PDR), a novel end-to-end video prediction paradigm that bridges the gap between discrete and continuous representations. Inspired by recent progress in 3D reconstruction with 3D…

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide powerful semantic understanding and commonsense reasoning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) planning. However, trajectories directly generated by VLMs often encode only coarse driving intentions and remain insufficient for geometrically accurate, future-aware, and multi-view-grounded planning. To address these limitations, we develop the Layer-Wise World-Model-Guided Driving framework (LWDrive). LWDrive is a VLM planning framework that refines coarse trajectories through layer-wise world-model guidance. Instead of treating the VLM output as the…

World models offer a principled way to equip long-horizon LLM agents with foresight: predictions of action consequences before execution. However, unreliable foresight can be ignored, misused, or even degrade downstream decision-making. In this paper, we introduce WorldEvolver, a self-evolving world model framework that revises its deployment-time context while keeping the downstream agent and all model parameters frozen. WorldEvolver integrates three modules: (i) Episodic Memory, which exploits real action transitions through retrieval-based simulation; (ii) Semantic Memory, which extracts…

Autonomous driving systems are steadily moving toward end-to-end paradigms to mitigate the limited adaptability of rule-based pipelines in complex traffic environments. However, most existing learning-based methods still make decisions from static representations of the current scene, without explicit future rollouts or modeling of the temporal causal dynamics in traffic interactions. This limitation often results in unstable or overly conservative planning under high-uncertainty conditions, such as occlusions and unexpected events. To overcome these challenges, we introduce OWMDrive, a…

Existing world model-based planners for visual navigation typically follow a verification-centric paradigm, decoupling goal intent from trajectory synthesis. This approach suffers from candidate dependence, heavy computational overhead, and inconsistencies between sampled actions and predicted visuals. To address these issues, we propose SWAM (Spatial-perceiving World Action Model), a task-centric joint observation-action generation framework. Given start and goal RGB observations, SWAM performs single-pass inference to simultaneously generate intermediate RGB-D sequences and corresponding…

Reliable generative AI models critically rely on expert human annotations to evaluate output quality, yet these "gold" labels are expensive to collect and limited in quantity. Organizations thus often turn to collecting vast but noisy "silver" labels from crowdsourced workers or vendor annotators as proxies for gold labels. Because gold remains the evaluation target, naively aggregating noisy silver labels may introduce bias, and estimators built on sparsely observed gold labels may have high variance to resolve the model performance gaps that guide practical decisions.

Class-incremental learning requires a model to learn new classes while preserving decision regions for old ones. This is difficult when raw old samples are no longer available. We propose Prototype Latent World Model Replay, a memory-free framework that stores old classes as distributions over stable hidden states rather than as images.

When new classes arrive, the model samples old latent states from…

High-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic urban environments is a cornerstone of autonomous driving simulation and large-scale world modeling. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established a new standard for real-time rendering, its reliance on expensive per-scene optimization limits scalability.

Synthetic data mitigates the data scarcity problem in autonomous driving perception. However, the synthetic-to-real gap leads to performance degradation, hindering real-world model generalization. Although current methods leverage diffusion models for photorealistic style transfer to bridge this gap, they critically ignore a practical asymmetry: while synthetic data possesses perfect pixel-level annotations, real-world style reference images generally lack corresponding labels. Consequently, existing methods relying on symmetric semantic guidance suffer from either prohibitive annotation…

World modeling requires forecasting uncertain futures while preserving information useful for downstream perception. Existing visual world models often struggle to satisfy both goals: VAE-based stochastic models operate in low-dimensional reconstruction latents, which can limit perception performance, while deterministic predictors using strong pretrained features collapse multimodal futures into a single blurry mean. In this work, we propose FlowWM, a stochastic world model that performs flow matching directly within pretrained feature space (e.g., DINOv3). This is challenging because…

Generative world models hold immense promise as scalable simulators for autonomous systems, particularly for synthesizing rare but safety-critical multi-agent interactions, such as vehicle collisions. However, current evaluation paradigms index heavily on visual fidelity and semantic alignment, leaving a critical blind spot: they cannot reliably quantify whether generated dynamics actually obey the fundamental physical laws required for reliable simulation. Assessing this physical plausibility is inherently difficult due to a lack of physical metrics and the challenge of extracting…

We propose a path-space formulation of prediction in AI world models. Rather than sequences of one-step conditional distributions, we argue that a world model implicitly defines a probability measure over future trajectories. In the local regime where latent dynamics admit an effective Markovian description, this path measure takes the Onsager-Machlup form. Within this framework, prediction (most probable trajectory), planning (constrained optimization), and uncertainty (fluctuations) emerge as operations on a single action functional. We decompose the latent dynamics into reversible and…

Classical SLAM estimates metric poses and a geometric map but produces no actionable predictive model for planning. Action-conditioned world models learn compact latent dynamics for planning but ignore global metric consistency and accumulate drift under open-loop rollout.

The bridge is a pose-conditioned latent encoder and a…

Video generation models have emerged as a promising paradigm for embodied world simulation. However, both general-domain video generators and robot-specific data fine-tuned models can still produce physically implausible manipulations, including discontinuous motion trajectories and inconsistent robot-object interactions, which limits their reliability as world simulators. Through extensive experiments, we find that such physical instability mainly arises from two factors: deformation of moving objects and implausible spatio-temporal correlations among interacting entities, particularly…

The AI community has framed the relationship between large language models (LLMs) and world models as a dichotomy: LLMs predict tokens; world models simulate reality. Yann LeCun argues in 2022 that reaching general intelligence requires abandoning autoregressive token prediction in favour of latent-space architectures. This framing is unnecessarily binary. Two claims will be defended. First, LLMs are a degenerate special case of world models: the state space is the set of all token sequences, the only action is appending one token, and world models are therefore a strict generalisation of…

### [Directing the World: Fast Autoregressive Video Generation with Compositional Human-Camera Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27964v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27964v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-26
- **作者**: Haoyuan Wang, Yabo Chen, Haibin Huang, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li

Building interactive world models requires generating realistic videos while maintaining controllable dynamics over long horizons. Autoregressive video generation offers a scalable foundation, but suffers from error accumulation and temporal degradation during extended rollouts. This issue is further amplified under heterogeneous controls such as human motion and camera trajectories, which may interfere and destabilize a pretrained video prior, while existing methods often trade off controllability and visual quality. We propose "Directing the World", a fast autoregressive framework for…

### [Grounded Iterative Language Planning: How Parameterized World Models Reduce Hallucination Propagation in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27806v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27806v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-26
- **作者**: Xinyuan Song, Zekun Cai

World models for language agents come in two useful forms. An agent-based world model calls an LLM API and reasons flexibly in language, but its errors appear as hallucinated state changes that are hard to score with ordinary regression losses. A parameterized world model is a trained transition predictor; its errors are easier to measure with quantities such as NodeMSE, delta accuracy, and validity accuracy, but it is usually weaker as a standalone planner. We compare these two families on four graph-structured planning benchmarks and introduce operational hallucination metrics for the…

### [Understanding Rollout Error in Graph World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27780v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27780v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-26

World models are often used for planning by rolling learned dynamics forward. Many planning environments, however, are not vectors or images; they are graphs of agents, tools, skills, routes, and dependencies. In these settings, a local prediction error may stay local or spread through the graph, and the failure mode changes again when edges are predicted rather than fixed. This paper studies long-horizon rollout error in Graph World Models (GWMs). We formulate a unified fixed-edge and dynamic-edge GWM framework with action nodes for node-, edge-, and graph-level decisions. We develop…

### [Textual Belief States for World Models: Identifiable Representation Learning Under Strict Mediation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27681v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27681v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-26
- **作者**: Xiang Gao, Kaiwen Dong, Yuguang Yao, Padmaja Jonnalagedda, Kamalika Das

World models in partially observed environments rely on latent representations that summarize interaction history, but in many modern LLM-based architectures predictive performance fails to reflect representation quality due to history bypass, rendering the latent state unidentifiable. Strict latent state mediation, requiring predictions to depend only on the latent state and action, is a classical principle that resolves this, but enforcing it in text-based settings is an open challenge: textual latent states are discrete and non-differentiable, precluding variational training, and…

### [CascadeOcc: Rethinking 3D Occupancy World Models with Cascaded VQ Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27644v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27644v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-26
- **作者**: Kyumin Hwang, Wonhyeok Choi, Jaeyeul Kim, Jihun Park, Daehee Park, Sunghoon Im

This letter proposes CascadeOcc, a novel occupancy world model that prioritizes intrinsic structural hierarchy over extrinsic auxiliary modalities for autonomous driving. Occupancy world models -- forecasting the future driving environment and planning the driving trajectory -- effectively bridge perception and planning, but current approaches often heavily rely on external modalities or large language models, failing to fully exploit the inherent structural potential of occupancy representations themselves. To enhance representational capacity for complex 3D scenes, we integrate a cascaded…

### [PhysiFormer: Learning to Simulate Mechanics in World Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27364v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27364v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Yiming Chen, Yushi Lan, Andrea Vedaldi

We present PhysiFormer, a diffusion transformer for physically-plausible 3D object motion. Unlike video world models that operate in view-dependent pixel space, PhysiFormer represents objects as 3D meshes expressed in world coordinates. Given the initial vertex positions and velocities, as well as object material type, rigid or elastic, the model samples future vertex trajectories. While related neural physics approaches build on ad-hoc latent spaces or explicitly enforce rigidity and causality, PhysiFormer shows that excellent results can be obtained without any such inductive biases, by…

### [Hallucination in World Models is Predictable and Preventable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27326v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27326v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Nicklas Hansen, Xiaolong Wang

Modern generative world models render increasingly realistic action-controllable futures, yet they frequently hallucinate: rollouts remain visually fluent while drifting from the ground-truth dynamics. We hypothesize that hallucination concentrates in low-coverage regions of the state-action space, where lightweight data-centric signals can both detect it and guide mitigation. To test this, we introduce MMBench2, a 427-hour, 210-task dataset for visual world modeling with ground-truth actions, rewards, and live simulators, and train a 350M-parameter world model on it. We identify three…

### [Not All Actions Are Equal: Rethinking Conditioning for Dexterous World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27325v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27325v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Zizhao Yuan, Zhengtu Liang, Taowen Wang, Qiwei Liang, Yichi Wang, Yunheng Wang et al.

Recent advances in action-conditioned world models show promising progress in modeling complex interactions and forecasting future states under diverse action sequences. While these models are often driven by stronger visual representations and model capacity, action conditioning itself remains underexplored. Most existing approaches compress the entire action sequence into a single representation, which works well for low-DoF control but becomes less reliable in high-DoF scenarios. We observe that high-DoF dexterous actions are inherently heterogeneous, spanning multiple orders of magnitude,…

### [EO-WM: A Physically Informed World Model for Probabilistic Earth Observation Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27277v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27277v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Junwei Luo, Shuai Yuan, Zhenya Yang, Yansheng Li, Zhe Liu, Hengshuang Zhao

Earth Observation (EO) forecasting aims to predict future Earth surface dynamics from satellite observations under changing meteorological conditions. In this paper, we view this task as a partially observed, weather-driven world modeling problem, in which weather acts as a conditioning signal, while forecasting remains uncertain due to sparse observations and unobserved land-surface states. However, existing methods do not fully capture this setting: deterministic models collapse uncertainty into a single future prediction, while diffusion-based methods typically treat weather variables as…

### [A Generalization Theory for JEPA-Based World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27014v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27014v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Jingyi Cui, Qi Zhang, Hongwei Wen, Yisen Wang

Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for world modeling by learning predictive dynamics in a latent space rather than generating future observations at the input level. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of JEPA-based world models remains limited. In this paper, we develop the first generalization theory for JEPA-based world models. We formulate JEPA pretraining as a conditional spectral graph learning problem and show that the JEPA objective is equivalent to a low-rank factorization of an action-conditioned…

Does intelligence require the ability to reason about phenomena beyond direct experience? It is natural to suspect that some complex thought cannot be captured through language alone. However, of particular concern to this work, is whether visualising counterfactual events can complement language as a mechanism for complex thought. We ask whether LLMs can be trained to utilise such visualisation mechanisms, in a way that benefits their reasoning abilities. Motivated by this question, we propose Einstein World Models. EWMs are a blueprint for LLM-based reasoning systems that place…

### [Look-Before-Move: Narrative-Grounded World Visual Attention in Dynamic 3D Story Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26964v1)

- **作者**: Jiaming Bian, Bingliang Li, Yuehao Wu, Pichao Wang, Zhi Wang, Hailan Ma et al.

As embodied AI and world models increasingly operate in dynamic 3D environments, visual perception must move beyond passively interpreting given observations toward actively deciding what to observe. We study this problem through camera planning in dynamic 3D story worlds, where the camera must not only generate smooth motion, but also decide what visual evidence should be acquired before it moves. We formulate this capability as Narrative-Grounded World Visual Attention, where the camera acts as an embodied observer that determines what to observe, how to compose the observation, and how to…

### [Risk-Aware Selective Multimodal Driver Monitoring with Driver-State World Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26922v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26922v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Daosheng Qiu, Haozhuang Chi, Hao Su, Shu Long, Xinyue Miao, Yongle Dong et al.

Continuous driver monitoring in automated vehicles requires low-latency inference while avoiding unsafe decisions under uncertain driver states. Large vision-language models provide broad multimodal priors, but their latency and limited reliability in this setting make them unsuitable as always-on in-cabin monitors. We propose a cost-aware selective inference framework for deployable multimodal driver monitoring. The core system is a lightweight RGB-physiological student that combines in-cabin visual observations with window-level HR/EDA signals, and a learned gate that decides when to accept…

- **作者**: Yuqi Jiang, Yumeng Liu, Zimu Li, Jinyuan Deng, Qian Jin, Yucheng Cui et al.

As semiconductor technology nodes scale, computational lithography is essential for ensuring yield and performance. However, lithography is a continuous physical process involving mask optimization, optical imaging, resist exposure, and development, which existing models fail to capture. To overcome this limitation, we present LithoDreamer, the first physics-informed World Model (WM) framework for computational lithography, which formulates the ``Layout-Mask-Resist Image-After Development Image (ADI)'' pipeline as a decision-driven multi-step evolution system. LithoDreamer captures feature…

- **作者**: Bin Hu, Yanwen Ma, Jiehui Huang, Ziliang Zhang, Haoning Wu, Ruicheng Zhang et al.

Recent game world models can synthesize visually plausible, action-conditioned rollouts. However, their interaction behaviors often remain limited to exploratory or wandering trajectories, and physical dynamics are typically learned as implicit correlations from data rather than as controllable variables. This limitation hinders their applicability to authored game environments, where physical rules are deliberately designed and require explicit manipulation. We introduce PhysEditWorld, a multimodal dataset with physical parameters, with a primary focus on gravity in this initial version. At…

### [Neural Voxel Dynamics: Learning Implicit 3D Physics via Volumetric Feature Advection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26410v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26410v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Zican Wang, Niloy Mitra

We present a self-supervised framework for learning implicit 3D physical dynamics directly from video-derived supervisory signals. While current generative video models achieve high visual fidelity, they lack a 3D geometric foundation, often resulting in physical inconsistencies and a failure to maintain object permanence. We address this by shifting the predictive bottleneck from 2D image space to a `lifted' 3D Volumetric Latent Space. Our method unprojects semantic features from a Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) into a voxelized grid, grounded by monocular depth…

Mobile manipulators need world models that are current, queryable, semantically meaningful, and usable under edge-compute constraints. This technical report presents KRVF, a source-aware semantic voxel world representation for edge mobile manipulation. Unlike reconstruction-centric mapping pipelines that primarily optimize global geometric fidelity, KRVF represents local world state as task-oriented voxels that encode occupancy, color, semantic evidence, temporal freshness, and evidence source. The representation separates measured occupancy from semantic-prior hypotheses, enabling…

- **arXiv**: `2606.26217v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Yuntian Gao, Xiangyu Xu

Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), including recent LeWorldModel (LeWM), have become a promising foundation for reconstruction-free visual world models. For visual planning, however, LeWM evaluates candidate action sequences by repeatedly applying a local one-step latent transition model. This autoregressive rollout makes planning computationally expensive and exposes the predicted trajectory to accumulated latent errors as the horizon grows. We propose Fast LeWorldModel (Fast-LeWM), a fast latent world model that replaces repeated local rollout with action-prefix prediction.…

AI agents are granted access to tools, APIs, and other infrastructure, making them active principals in those systems. The dominant approach places controls inside the agent's own runtime: system prompts, output filters, and guardrail libraries. Any control in the agent's address space is reachable by inputs that influence it; this generalizes to any AI system with sufficient reach into its own runtime, a class we term escapable AI systems. We identify four properties that an authorization mechanism must satisfy for architectural control rather than for cooperative requests: process…

- **作者**: Siyin Wang, Junhao Shi, Senyu Fei, Zhaoyang Fu, Li Ji, Jingjing Gong et al.

Modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often fail to generalize to novel setups, such as altered camera viewpoints or robot morphologies, because they are typically conditioned only on current observations and language instructions. By ignoring the underlying system configuration as a variable, these models implicitly assume a fixed execution context encountered during training, necessitating data-intensive fine-tuning for any new environment. In this work, we introduce In-Context World Modeling (ICWM), a framework that treats system identification as an in-context adaptation problem.…

### [USS: Unified Spatial-Semantic Prompts for Embodied Visual Tracking with Latent Dynamics Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.25880v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.25880v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Yuchen Xie, Xinyu Zhou, Kuangji Zuo, Yanshuo Lu, Fengrui Huang, Boyu Ma et al.

Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) requires an agent to continuously follow a specified target while actively moving through dynamic environments. However, prevailing EVT paradigms predominantly rely on language-based target indication. While language is expressive and convenient, cluttered scenes often contain multiple objects that satisfy the same semantic description, leading to ambiguous target grounding. We therefore propose a paradigm shift, reframing target indication in EVT from text-only specification to unified spatial-semantic prompting. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Unified…

### [Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: Diagnosis-Driven Online Reinforcement Learning with Offline Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.25527v1)

Online reinforcement learning (RL) agents increasingly depend on knowledge acquired offline to achieve practical efficiency. Originally studied in offline-to-online RL, this paradigm now spans foundation model post-training and embodied intelligence, with prior types expanding from offline datasets and pre-trained policies to increasingly diverse knowledge sources such as multimodal foundation models and generative world models. Offline priors have become central to how deep RL is developed and deployed. However, this reliance introduces a challenge that the prevailing benchmark-driven…

Autoregressive video diffusion with causal diffusion transformers has emerged as a major paradigm for real-time streaming video generation and action-conditioned interactive world models. In this work, we extend rCM, an advanced diffusion distillation framework, to autoregressive video diffusion. The core philosophy of rCM lies in the complementarity between forward and reverse divergences, represented by consistency models (CMs) and distribution matching distillation (DMD), respectively, in diffusion distillation. This philosophy naturally carries over to the autoregressive setting, where…

### [Hypergraph Normal World Models for Logical Visual Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.25368v1)

Visual anomaly detection is often deployed with only normal training images. Most one-class detectors map test patches or features to a normal reference distribution. This works well for local structural defects. Logical anomalies are different. Each visible part may look normal, while the whole image violates a normal count, co-occurrence, or spatial relation. This paper studies whether a model can learn such a category-specific normal world from nominal images alone. We propose the Hypergraph Normal World Model, a normal-only detector that distills frozen DINOv2 patch tokens into patch,…
